ttcdt-html2epub - Converts HTML or plain text files to EPUB format
ttcdt <dev@triptico.com>

This is a tool that converts a set of HTML or plain text files to EPUB
format (plain text files are converted to HTML on the fly). After, as
usual, being bored + frustrated by the cumbersome available tools to do
this apparently trivial operation, this is my approach. It's just a shell
script. The only mandatory dependency is the `zip' program; if the
`uuidgen' utility is installed, it's used as well. Also, output quality
will be much improved if you install the `tidy' tool, because it shall be
automatically used to ensure your HTML files are XMLized.

The EPUB specification is fucking braindead. Do not be confused with
all that MIME and content types everywhere: the only supported format
is fucking XHTML (no support for pure text/html). It's up to you to
have valid XHTML files (or have the `tidy' tool installed).

Released into the public domain. Use as you want, specially for evil.
